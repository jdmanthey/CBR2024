# Intro to R - Starting on 25 January 2024

Today will begin an introduction to R through an online resource called Software Carpentry. R is a computer language for 
statistical computing, creating figures / graphs, and manipulating large or many data files without having to manually look,
edit, or change things in a text editor or spreadsheet editor. We will be using R for most of the hands-on lessons
for the rest of the semester, and so you'll need to have a working understanding of how things generally work, and know 
what to look for / search on Google if you don't know how something is working. 

&nbsp;

The website for the lesson is found [here](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/). We will be doing the lesson called
"Programming with R." Click on the data site link to this lesson. This will take you to the learning page with 15 modules. 
This is far too many to complete in class today, but we'll have class time next week Tuesday as well and then any other 
sections that need to be completed should be done prior to February 6 when we start other activities. Please make sure to 
work through slowly and comprehensively exercise #s: 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15. This should take a few hours 
to work through, and if you take your time with it, will make the exercises later in the class that much easier.

&nbsp;

First, make sure that the computer you are using has RStudio installed. We will use this program to implement R lessons and
code throughout the semester. Once you are ready with that, work through the "Summary and Setup" page in the Programming with R lessons page.
Once you have created the necessary directory and downloaded the files to that directory, you are ready to go with lesson 1.

# Expected Learning Outcomes

The expected learning outcomes for each of the lessons are in the objectives column on each page. After the first day
or two, you should be able to:
1. Read data into R
2. Be able to assign variables in R
3. Know what a data frame is and be able to access (i.e., use) different parts of it
4. Calculate some simple statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation
5. Learn where to look for help if you want to know more information about functions or other aspects of R
6. Be able to make a simple plot
